This Calculator helps people who wants to sell stuff online (Amazon, Ebay, Trendyol, Hepsiburada etc.)
but this platforms charges commission for every sale you made.
You want to decide price for your stuff but you want fixed %25 percent profit on your buying price

For example:

you buy a shirt for 10$
you want %25 profit so price becomes 12.5$
you choose free shipment for customers but you pay 2.5$ per package for shipment so price becomes 15$
platform charges you %20 percent commission on your final price then what should your final price must be ?
is it 18$ ?
no!
if your final price is 18$, total commission you are going to pay is 3.6$ so you get 14.4$
you pay 2.5$ for shipment and you will get 11.9$
Now your %25 profit is 19% percent

If you don't want to deal with all of this calculations maybe this app can help you :)
